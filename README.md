# Quiz App - Test Your Knowledge and Have Fun! 🎉

## About the Project

Hey, folks! Welcome to my Quiz App—a space where you can challenge your wits with some super engaging questions. Check out the [screenshots](#) to see what it looks like!

### Reflecting on the Journey 🛠

#### My Role & Responsibilities
I was the lone ranger here, wearing all the hats—from architecting the quiz to sprinkling in that fancy styling.

#### Decision Making & What Followed
Went with jQuery for all those nifty interactions. A bit sluggish on ancient browsers, but a smooth ride overall.

#### The Rewind Button ⏪
If I could hit rewind, I'd probably give React a spin for scalability. A backend would be nifty for more questions.

#### Learning Curve 📚
- A solid plan beats winging it any day.
- jQuery and Font Awesome are serious time-savers.

### Tech Tools 🛠
- [HTML5](#)
- [CSS3](#)
- [JavaScript](#)

### Extras 🌟
