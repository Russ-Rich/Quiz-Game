# Quiz App - Test Your Knowledge and Have Fun!

## About the Project

Hey there! I built this Quiz App to offer a fun way for folks to challenge themselves with a series of questions. It's a smooth experience with immediate feedback on your answers. Let's dive into what went down during the development process.

### Reflecting on the Journey

#### My Role and What I Did
I was the Sole Developer for this project, responsible for everything from the structure of the quiz to coding the logic for questions and scoring. I also took care of making it look nice.

#### Decision Making and What Followed
I decided to use jQuery for handling the interactions because it's fast to work with. The only downside might be a little slowness on very old browsers, but it's mostly smooth sailing.

#### If I Could Hit the Rewind Button
Looking back, I might consider using a more modern tool like React for future growth. I'd also think about adding a backend to store even more questions.

#### What I Picked Up Along the Way
- Planning and organizing make a world of difference.
- Using tools like jQuery and Font Awesome saved me a lot of time.

### Tech Tools Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Font Awesome icons

### Extras
- **User Flows**: I made some diagrams to figure out how users would navigate through the app.
- **User Stories**: I outlined what I wanted users to experience and achieve.
- **Kanban Board**: This helped me keep track of tasks and stay on course.

## How to Get It Running
Just download everything and open `play.html` in your favorite browser.

## How to Play
